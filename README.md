## About me

- 🎓 Ph.D. candidate in Theoretical Chemistry at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, in the *Theory and Simulation of Complex System* group (group leader: Jun.-Prof. Jan Meisner)
- 🧪 Work on **nanoreactor method** and automatic **reaction discovery**  
- 🤖 Use **machine-learning interatomic potentials** and active learning to accelerate atomistic simulations  
- 💻 Enjoy building **Python** tooling around simulation workflows, ML models, and data analysis

## Selected projects

- 🔬 **[PeakAnalyzer](https://github.com/jthemmaster/PeakAnalyzer)**  
  Jupyter-based toolkit for peak detection, fitting, and visualization of experimental spectra, developed during my PhD research.

- 🧠 **[ClassifAI](https://github.com/jthemmaster/ClassifAI)**  
  A small Python project for image classification with PyTorch, including training scripts, data handling, and experiment tracking using mlflow.

- 🌐 **[AUTOGRAPH](https://github.com/failip/autograph)**  
  Web-based 3D visualization tool for constructing and exploring chemical reaction networks. I contributed the implementation of a shortest-path algorithm for navigating large reaction networks, enabling on-the-fly path finding.

- 🧪 **[torchani fork](https://github.com/jthemmaster/torchani)**  
  Fork of TorchANI used to explore neural network potentials for chemistry.
